# Python_Snake
Hi there, here is my first python coding proeject.

This program uses turtle graphics to create a simple snake game.

The objective of this game is for the snake to eat as many fruits as it can and grow longer without hitting any of the borders or its own tail, otherwise it is game over. 

Have Fun :)
